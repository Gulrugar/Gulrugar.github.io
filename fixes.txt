!!! Before implementing any changes make a commit and push your code to github

1. the mobile menu blips (check out weeklyhow's udemy tutorial to see how t get rid of that, also i believe traversy media also had a way to deal with it for his space-x clone tutorial)

2. Add a full menu header on desktops with dropdowns to individual projects
3. Add drop downs to the hamburger menu
4. Add dark mode switcher

notes:
add a "My Skills" section after "What I do" section
