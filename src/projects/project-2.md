  This is my first project so I tried to incorporate as many shopify
  features as I could think of. Mostly adapting features from Shopify's
  Dawn theme to features found on the website fromyouflowers.com.

  I would say the part I'm most proud of is the functionality of the image
  gallery on the product page.

    target="_blank"
    >See assets/carousel.js in the GitHub repo</a

<p>
  That's because most of it is my original code and the only guidance I
  could find for it was vague suggestions of how the code works that I
  gathered from the Firefox dev tools.
