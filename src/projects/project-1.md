<p>
  This project started out with me wanting to learn how to make certain
  features animate based on the window resizing and scrolling.
</p>
<p>
  But as I made those features I also found even more eye-catching effects
  and ended up remaking the whole site.
</p>
<p style="text-decoration: underline">
  When viewing the project I recommend:
</p>
<ol style="max-width: 600px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto">
  <li>Resizing the window width and watch the header</li>
  <li>
    Scrolling down the homepage on a fullscreen and watching the <br />
    left and right margins
  </li>
</ol>
