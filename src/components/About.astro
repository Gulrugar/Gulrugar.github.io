            I'm Drew and I'm a 33 year old Web Developer that specializes in
            making Shopify Stores and Apps. I'm also a college graduate with a
            Bachelor of Science in Mathematics.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started learning to code so that I could automate making flash
            cards from online dictionaries. As I became more experienced, I
            started making my own games.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually I wanted to learn how to build websites and that led me
            to learning a variety of frameworks until I decided that the popular
            MERN stack was a great choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            As my skills grew, I realized that I wanted to make web development
            my career and I thought about how I could use my skills to provide
            the most value to people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing that e-commerce was becoming very popular and being inspired
            by e-commerce websites, which were some of the most visually
            stunning ones I had ever seen, I became a Shopify Developer and
            started building stores for clients.
