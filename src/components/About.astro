      I am a graduate of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles,
      with a B.S. in Math. I am a former active military member, having served
      as a United States Coastguardsman.

      I became interested in coding after using the programming language Python
      to automate the creation of flashcards for the popular flashcard app Anki.
      I was amazed by the power of coding when I transformed approximately 24
      hours of manual card creation into just one hour of enjoyable reading,
      while my computer generated the cards for me.
